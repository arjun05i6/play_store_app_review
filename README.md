The dataset contains reviews from the Google Play Store and includes the following columns:

reviewId: Unique identifier for each review.
userName: Name of the user who submitted the review.
userImage: URL of the user's image.
content: The text content of the review.
score: The rating given by the user (typically 1 to 5).
thumbsUpCount: The number of thumbs-up votes the review received.
reviewCreatedVersion: The app version at the time of the review.
at: Timestamp of when the review was submitted.
replyContent: The content of any reply to the review.
repliedAt: Timestamp of when the reply was made.
appVersion: The app version being reviewed.
userLang: The language of the user.
app_id: The unique identifier of the app.
sentiment: The sentiment of the review (positive, neutral, negative) - calculated during analysis.
subjectivity: The subjectivity of the review text - calculated during analysis.
polarity: The polarity of the review text - calculated during analysis.
Steps Performed
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Checked for and handled any missing values.
Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g., datetime).
2. Sentiment Analysis
Used the TextBlob library to calculate sentiment polarity and subjectivity for each review.
Added sentiment, subjectivity, and polarity columns to the DataFrame.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized the distribution of scores using bar charts.
Created word clouds for positive and negative reviews to identify common themes.
Analyzed sentiment trends over time.
Investigated the relationship between app versions and sentiment subjectivity.
4. Visualizations
Generated various plots to visualize insights:
Pie chart showing the distribution of sentiments across all reviews.
Histogram of app sizes across the database.
Box plots to analyze the relationship between score and sentiment polarity.
Histograms and KDE plots for the thumbsUpCount column.

Key Insights and Recommendations

Insights
Distribution of Scores:
Most reviews are concentrated in the higher score range (4 and 5), indicating general satisfaction.
There are notable portions of lower scores (1 and 2), suggesting areas for improvement.
Sentiment Distribution:
Positive sentiments dominate the reviews, reinforcing high average scores.
Negative sentiments highlight specific issues or dissatisfaction.
Sentiment Trends Over Time:

Fluctuations in user satisfaction over different periods.
Periods with spikes in negative sentiments often correspond to specific app updates or changes.
Sentiment Distribution Across App Versions:

Certain app versions receive higher negative sentiments, indicating potential issues or bugs introduced in those versions.
Common Themes in Reviews:

Positive reviews often mention ease of use and great features.
Negative reviews highlight issues such as crashes, bugs, and poor performance.
